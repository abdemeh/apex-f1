# Introduction & Inspiration

Welcome to **Apex F1**. I built this project for one simple reason: **I love Formula 1.**

But let's be honest, I mostly built it because I am a huge **Max Verstappen** fan.
**MAX VERSTAPPEN TU TU TU DU MAX VERSTAPPEN**

Every time I look at the standings, I want to see that #1 right at the top. So I created this dashboard to track the season, the drivers, and the teams in style. If you are a Hamilton fan, you are welcome too (but please don't look at the 2021 stats).

For the full experience, please play the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo6Ydw9x9dE&list=RDmo6Ydw9x9dE" target="_blank">Netherlands Anthem</a> while browsing this repo.

# The Project Explained

This is a modern, responsive Single Page Application (SPA) built to visualize Formula 1 data. It's not just a list of numbers; it's designed to look and feel like a premium F1 product.

## Key Features

* **Home Dashboard**: Shows the countdown to the next race (so you never miss lights out) and the current championship leaders.
* **Drivers Hub**: A complete grid of all drivers for the current season. Click on a driver to see their detailed stats, points, and bio.
* **Constructors (Teams)**: Detailed information about every team on the grid.
* **Standings**: Live updated driver and constructor standings.
* **Circuits**: Explore all the tracks on the calendar.
* **Internationalization**: Fully bilingual (English & French).

## Tech Stack

* **React 19**: The core framework. I used functional components and hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`) throughout.
* **Vite**: The build tool. It's incredibly fast and makes development a breeze.
* **React Router**: For seamless navigation between pages without reloading.
* **i18next**: For handling translations. Because F1 is a global sport.
* **CSS Modules / Vanilla CSS**: Custom styling with a focus on a dark, neon-accented aesthetic (Glassmorphism).

# API & Data Architecture

This is where the magic happens. I didn't just hardcode the data; I fetch it live from reliable sources.

### 1. Ergast API (via Jolpica)

The **Ergast Developer API** is the backbone of this app. I use it to fetch:

* **Season Data**: Race schedules and results.
* **Standings**: Who is leading the championship.
* **Details**: Specific data for drivers, teams, and circuits.

*Implementation Details*:
I created a dedicated service `src/services/f1Api.js` using `axios`. It handles all the HTTP requests to `https://api.jolpi.ca/ergast/f1`.

### 2. OpenF1 API

The Ergast API is great for numbers, but it lacks visuals. That's where **OpenF1** comes in.

* **Driver Images**: I use this API to fetch high-quality headshots of the drivers.
* **Caching Strategy**: To avoid hitting the API rate limits and to speed up the app, I implemented a custom caching mechanism in `f1Api.js`. Once we fetch the driver images, we store them in memory (`driverImagesCache`). Subsequent requests use the cache, making the app feel instant.

### 3. Fallbacks

APIs can be flaky. If an image fails to load or isn't found, I have robust fallback mechanisms (using official F1 placeholders) so the UI never looks broken.

# Design & Assets

* **The Logo**: Yes, the logo was generated by AI. I'm a developer, not a graphic designer!
* **Fonts**: I imported custom fonts (`Formula1-Bold`, `Formula1-Regular`) to match the official F1 broadcast typography.
